<p>Children of Digital Age's purpose is to <b>form today’s children to be
  tomorrow’s programmers.</b></p>

<p>Since IT is an ever-growing field there is a lot of potential in knowing
programming from earlier ages. However, learning it can be a sterile attempt
frail with failures.  This is why our business plans to teach children how to
code using interactive approaches, making them learn by doing and having
fun.</p>
